# Json Web Token Cryptographic Keypair

## Create the keys

You should change the value of `JWT_PASSPHRASE` in your environment before generating the keys.

Either generate the keys yourself:

```shell script
$ . alias
$ generateJwt
```

Or you can copy/rename the distributed files, as they match the default password stored in `JWT_PASSPHRASE` in `.env`.
